                <p>The App is not intended for children under 16 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 16.

                <h2>Third-Party Information Collection</h2>
                <p>When you use the App or its content, certain third parties may use automatic information collection technologies, or other public sources to collect information about you or your device. These third parties may include:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.</p>
                <p>We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.</p>

                <h2>Sensitive Data Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We understand that certain information you provide to us through the App may be considered sensitive personal data under applicable laws (e.g., GDPR). This can include:</p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p>We collect and process this data exclusively for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, such as providing personalized nutritional analyses, meal insights, and related functionalities within the App.</p>

                <h3>Explicit Consent for Sensitive Data</h3>
                <p>By uploading or inputting any sensitive data (including photos, audio recordings, or detailed health metrics) within the App, you explicitly consent to our collection and processing of such data as outlined in this Privacy Policy and, where applicable, under Article 9(2)(a) of the GDPR. You may withdraw this consent at any time by contacting us at support@nutricam.app. Please note, however, that withdrawing consent may limit or prevent your ability to use certain features of the App.</p>

                <h3>Data Minimization</h3>
                <p>We are committed to the principle of data minimization. This means we only collect the minimal amount of sensitive data necessary to fulfill the specific purpose of providing accurate nutritional information and personalized recommendations. We do not use your sensitive data for any unrelated or secondary purposes without your explicit permission, and we will not retain it for longer than is necessary to achieve the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK Users)</h2>
                <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom (UK), we rely on the following lawful bases under applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR) to process your personal data:</p>
                <h4>Contractual Necessity</h4>
                <p>We collect certain personal data (such as your email address, subscription details, and basic account information) to perform our agreement with you—i.e., to create and maintain your account, handle billing, and deliver the services you request.</p>
                <h4>Explicit Consent for Sensitive Data</h4>
                <p>We rely on your explicit consent when you provide sensitive or health-related information (e.g., height, weight, body fat, photos, or voice recordings) so that we can offer personalized nutritional analyses. You can withdraw this consent at any time by contacting us at support@nutricam.app, although doing so may limit certain features of the App.</p>
                <h4>Legal Obligation</h4>
                <p>In some cases, we may need to keep records or process certain data to comply with legal requirements, such as tax or accounting rules.</p>
                <h4>Legitimate Interests</h4>
                <p>We may process certain non-sensitive data (like usage analytics, logs) to improve our services, enhance security, prevent fraud, or understand how users interact with the App. We ensure these interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>

                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information, to:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The usage information we collect helps us to improve our App and to deliver a better and more personalized experience by enabling us to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Estimate our audience size and usage patterns.</li>
                    <li>Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our App according to your individual interests.</li>

                </ul>

Even though we do not disclose your personal information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria.</p>

                <h2>How We Store Your Information</h2>
                <p>We store your data on Supabase servers, which are protected by advanced encryption and security measures. Supabase employs various security techniques including encryption of data at rest and in transit to protect your personal information.</p>
                <p>We will keep your personal data as long as you use the App. After you cease using the App or request deletion of your data, we will retain your information for an additional period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Once this period has expired, we will delete your data by removing it from our servers and any backups in a manner designed to ensure that it cannot be reconstructed or read.</p>
                <p>Like most commercial websites, we use cookies to track use of our Site. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences. NutriCam and our Service Providers use cookies to track use of our Site and online services.

                    <li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.</li>
                    <li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.</li>

We allow some Advertisers to assist us with behavioral advertising by collecting and analyzing certain information when you visit our Site (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject clicked or scrolled over). These Advertisers typically use a cookie or other technologies to personalize advertising content and measure the effectiveness of their ads. We do not provide personal health information, or PHI, to Advertisers. Additionally, for users paying for our Services, we may from time to time send you offers from Advertisers, but generally speaking you will not be subject to the targeted advertisements mentioned above.</li>
                    <li>As Aggregated or Deidentified Information. We reserve the right to share or sell aggregated, anonymous or deidentified information about any individuals with non-affiliated entities for marketing, advertising, research or other purposes, without restriction.
