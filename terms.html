                the request of any government authority, as any applicable law or regulation dictates, or to
                investigate a potential violation of these Terms and Conditions. In such cases, NutriCam, in its sole

                additional information and documents are processed by NutriCam. If you do not provide complete
                and accurate information in response to such a request, NutriCam may refuse to restore your

                <p>The Third-Party Content and Service are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To

                <p><strong>PROFESSIONAL DISCLAIMER:</strong> The Service cannot and does not contain medical/health advice.
                Any nutritional or health-related information is provided for general informational and educational

                <h2>9. Arbitration</h2>
                <p>Please read this section (“Arbitration Clause”) carefully. It is part of your agreement with
                NutriCam and affects your rights.</p>
                <p>THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO
                GO TO COURT AND HA VE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY , instead electing
                that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Clause.
                Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules
                applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation
                should arise between you and NutriCam in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce
                an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND NutriCam WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY
                TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
                <p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE
                MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A
                CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE
                ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
                OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.</p>
                <p>The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision; the
                arbitrator shall apply Delaware law to all other matters. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
                including issues related to scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision. Notwithstanding
                anything to the contrary, any party to the arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms
                of equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice
                of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested
                relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: NutriCam, support@NutriCam.app. After the
                Notice is received, you and NutriCam may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If
                you and NutriCam do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is
                received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.</p>
                <p>Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before a single AAA
                arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
                Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA's
                rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written
                submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The
                decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgment on the arbitration award
                may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Arbitration Clause shall survive
                expiration, termination, or rescission of this Agreement.</p>

                <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>You will indemnify and hold harmless NutriCam and its officers, directors, agents, partners,
                employees, licensors, distributors, representatives, and affiliates from and against any and all
                claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, losses, damages, costs, and expenses,
                including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from or relating to your access and/or use of or
                interaction with the Third-Party Content, or any act, error, or omission of your use of your account
                or any user of your account, in connection therewith, including, but not limited to, matters relating
                to incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information; libel; invasion of privacy; infringement of a
                copyright, trade name, trademark, service mark, or other intellectual property; any defective product
                or any injury or damage to person or property caused by any products sold or otherwise distributed
                through or in connection with the Service; or violation of any applicable law.</p>

                <h2>11. Service Fees</h2>
                <p>NutriCam currently operates on a freemium model. This means that certain features of the Service are available free of charge, while access to premium features may require a paid subscription or in-app purchase. NutriCam may, at its sole discretion and without prior notice, modify which features are available for free or introduce new paid offerings at any time.</p>
                <p>Paid features may include, but are not limited to, advanced analytics, personalized insights, historical tracking, and AI-enhanced functionalities. Subscriptions, if offered, may be billed on a monthly or annual basis through the Apple App Store or other designated platforms. Trial periods may be made available from time to time and will automatically convert into a paid subscription unless cancelled before the trial period ends.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for reviewing the applicable fees, features, and billing terms before making any purchase. All subscription management, billing, and cancellations are handled through the Apple App Store (or the respective platform through which you subscribed), and you agree to comply with their payment policies.</p>
                <p>NutriCam reserves the right to modify pricing, introduce additional payment tiers, offer promotional pricing, or discontinue any aspect of the freemium model at any time.</p>

                <h2>12. Advertising and Sponsored Content</h2>
                <p>NutriCam may display advertisements, sponsored content, or promotional materials within the Service. These ads help support the continued development and availability of the Service, especially for users accessing free or trial versions. By using the Service, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ads may be served by NutriCam or third-party advertising networks (e.g., Google AdMob, AppLovin).</li>
                    <li>These third parties may use tracking technologies (such as device identifiers or cookies) to deliver targeted advertising based on your interests or usage patterns.</li>
                    <li>NutriCam is not responsible for the content of third-party ads or the accuracy of any claims made in them.</li>
                    <li>Your interaction with any advertisements or third-party services is solely between you and the advertiser.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are located in a jurisdiction that requires user consent for personalized ads (e.g., the European Economic Area), NutriCam will seek your consent through an appropriate Consent Management Platform (CMP) before serving personalized advertising.</p>
                <p>Please review our Privacy Policy for details on how your data may be used for advertising purposes.</p>

                <h2>13. Termination</h2>
                <p>You agree that, without notice, NutriCam may terminate these Terms and Conditions, or suspend
                your access to the Service or the Third-Party Content, with or without cause at any time and
                effective immediately. These Terms and Conditions will terminate immediately without notice from
                NutriCam if you, in NutriCam’s sole determination, fail to comply with any provision of these
                Terms and Conditions. NutriCam shall not be liable to you or any third party for the termination or
                suspension of the Service or the Content, or any claims related to such termination or suspension.</p>
                <p>NutriCam may discontinue or modify the Third-Party Content, or any portion thereof, at any time.
                You release and agree to indemnify and hold harmless NutriCam for any loss or damages arising
                from or relating to such discontinuation or modification.</p>

                <h2>14. Applicable Law and Venue</h2>
                <p>You agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of
                the State of Delaware, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. To the extent
                allowable, beyond the arbitration clause below, any legal action or proceeding arising under this
                Agreement will be brought exclusively in courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, and you
                irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.</p>

                <h2>15. Severability</h2>
                <p>If any provision of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then
                that provision will be deemed severable from every other provision of the Agreement, and will not
                affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.</p>

                <h2>16. Revisions to these Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <p>NutriCam may at any time revise these Terms and Conditions by updating this Agreement. You
                agree to be bound by subsequent revisions and agree to review these Terms and Conditions
                periodically for changes. The most updated version of this document will be available for your
                review under the “Terms of Service” link that appears on NutriCam’s website.</p>
